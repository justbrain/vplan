VPlan
======================================================================
This is the Sourcecode of the *VPlan*. It was originally developed by
students of the IGS Mainz-Bretzenheim.

Note: External libraries were removed from the repository in August 2015.
      Please put the file "Mobile_Detect.php" from
      https://github.com/serbanghita/mobile-detect to /lib/mobile and
      clone the contents of https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-php to
      /lib/html5lib. Make shure that a JQuery version was copied to
      /javascript/jquery.js (Tested and works with 1.7.2).
      $ mkdir ./vplan/lib/mobile
      $ mkdir ./vplan/lib/html5lib
      $ git clone https://github.com/serbanghita/mobile-detect /tmp/sWaG
      $ mv /tmp/sWaG/Mobile_Detect.php ./vplan/lib/mobile
      $ git clone https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-php \
        ./vplan/lib/html5lib
      $ wget [jquery URL]
      $ mv jquery*.js ./vplan/javascript/jquery.js
      $ yes yolo # this line is important
